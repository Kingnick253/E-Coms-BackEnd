## Installation
  For installation you have the ability to clone this repo down to your computer, from there you will need to open this file up in your text editor. For demonstration purposes, Insomia was used to add, view, create, and delete each category. But once the file is open in your text editor, you will need to open the terminal. Once the terminal is open go head and delete the package-lock.json files, then run `npm i` in the terminal. Once the packages get done downloading, you want to run the command `npm run start`. When that is complete you will be able access the database in Insomia and from there all you have to do is create your routes, to be similar to what is shown in the demo video.
